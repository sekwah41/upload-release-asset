# GitHub Action - Releases API


**Please note:** This is just to fix the original action for my specific use cases.
Feel free to use it as you wish or open an issue if you want/need additional behaviors.

I believe there are other actions out there that can be used for this purpose, though it was hard to figure out which ones worked or were unmaintained.
Also, they didn't seem to work as a direct replacement.

**This is meant to act as a direct replacement for the original action with clearly documented changes.**

If you are having any troubles, you can enable additional logs and info by setting `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` to `true` in your secretes

# Edits

## With Variables
 * `asset_path` can now take wildcards as well as an array of paths. Uses [@actions/glob](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/glob) so the same as [actions/upload-artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact)
 * `asset_name` Will be ignored if there are multiple files
 * `asset_content_type` is now optional

## Outputs
 * `browser_download_url` is now an array of url's

This GitHub Action (written in JavaScript) wraps the [GitHub Release API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/), specifically the [Upload a Release Asset](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#upload-a-release-asset) endpoint, to allow you to leverage GitHub Actions to upload release assets.

[![Tests](https://github.com/sekwah41/upload-release-asset/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sekwah41/upload-release-asset/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Usage
### Pre-requisites
Create a workflow `.yml` file in your repositories `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow---upload-a-release-asset) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file). You also will need to have a release to upload your asset to, which could be created programmatically by [`@actions/create-release`](https://www.github.com/actions/create-release) as show in the example workflow.

### Inputs
For more information on these inputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#input-2)

- `upload_url`: The URL for uploading assets to the release, which could come from another GitHub Action, for example the [`@actions/create-release`](https://www.github.com/actions/create-release) GitHub Action

### Outputs
For more information on these outputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#response-for-successful-upload) for an example of what these outputs look like

- `id`: The ID of the asset
- `browser_download_url`: The URL users can navigate to in order to download the release asset. i.e. `https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/releases/download/v1.0.0/example.zip`

### Example workflow - upload a release asset
On every `push` to a tag matching the pattern `v*`, [create a release](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release) and [upload a release asset](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#upload-a-release-asset). This Workflow example assumes you have the [`@actions/create-release`](https://www.github.com/actions/create-release) Action in a previous step:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/tags
    tags:
    - 'v*' # Push events to matching v*, i.e. v1.0, v20.15.10

name: Upload Release Asset

jobs:
  build:
    name: Upload Release Asset
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build project # This would actually build your project, using zip for an example artifact
        run: |
          zip --junk-paths my-artifact README.md
      - name: Create Release
        id: create_release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
          release_name: Release ${{ github.ref }}
          draft: false
          prerelease: false
      - name: Upload Release Asset
        id: upload-release-asset
        uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          upload_url: ${{ steps.create_release.outputs.upload_url }} # This pulls from the CREATE RELEASE step above, referencing it's ID to get its outputs object, which include a `upload_url`. See this blog post for more info: https://jasonet.co/posts/new-features-of-github-actions/#passing-data-to-future-steps
          asset_path: ./my-artifact.zip
          asset_name: my-artifact.zip
          asset_content_type: application/zip
```

This will upload a release artifact to an existing release, outputting the `browser_download_url` for the asset which could be handled by a third party service, or by GitHub Actions for additional uses. For more information, see the GitHub Documentation for the [upload a release asset](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#upload-a-release-asset) endpoint.
